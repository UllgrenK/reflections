When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I work with other people, or when I want to share my code for others to use.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If others have made changes to the master branch, I want to know it won't conflict with my changes. The other thing is, that I want to publish code only when the functionalities are complete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: I want to modify code, that I don't have direct rights to modify. My changes are only available in my fork. I can suggest changes to the original code, but the orignal author will decide if she accepts them.
Clone: clone a repository to my local machine. I can pull and push changes from and to the github repository. Others can have rights to modify the github repository. I use this when I develop stomething in collaboration with others, or want to publish my code openly available.
Branch: I can create a branch on my local computer for developing a new feature. I can merge to the master and push to the github repository when the feature is ready.

Random reflections: didn't quite get the idea of fast forward merge. Maybe I'll get it later.
To solve the merge conflict, I had to revisit the previous lesson, since I had forgotten how to solve merge conflicts and commit the solved file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can compile and run a my code locally.
